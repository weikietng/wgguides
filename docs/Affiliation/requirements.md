All requirements are listed below. However, some of these requirements may be exempted if the group has excellent potential and quality. 
:::

Water Grillâ€™s representative will conduct evaluation from time to time on all of our alliances to ensure all the standards and requirements are met. If the requirements are not met, we will hand out an official warning and you will have 2 (Two) weeks to make sure you are up to our standard. This evaluation DOES NOT include member count. 

After you submit your application, Water Grill will send a member of our public relation team to carry out a thorough evaluation within your community to ensure that your community fits our requirements and standard.

In order for you to be exempted from a certain requirement, you will have to contact the current head of the public relation department directly and he will carry out a personal evaluation to determine whether your community may be exempted from the requirement.
